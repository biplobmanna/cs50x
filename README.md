# All the programs one while following through CS50x

## Week 1
* Basics

## Week 2
* Basics

## Week 3
* Algorithms - sorting
* Plurality
    * Using function-pointers to allocate/free memory dynamically to the string inside the struct
    * Using a dynamically allocated array of pointers to store pointers to variable-length strings of the struct
    * Using merge sort to sort the data
    * Keep in mind to free the data wherever needed, otherwise it will cause a bottleneck.
